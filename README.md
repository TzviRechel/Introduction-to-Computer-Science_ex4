# Shape Drawing Application

Ariel University, School of Computer Science, 2023  
Introduction to Computer Science - Ex4: Main OOP Assignment

This project is a comprehensive assignment that involves implementing a set of geometric shapes, a shape container, a basic graphical user interface (GUI), and basic save/load capabilities. Each shape can be filled with a different color, rotated, moved, copied, enlarged, or shrunk. The application allows sorting shapes according to different criteria, such as area or perimeter. Additionally, the project includes the implementation of JUnit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and methods.
