# Shape Drawing Application

Ariel University, School of Computer Science, 2022  
Introduction to Computer Science - Ex4: Main OOP Assignment

## Abstract

This project is a comprehensive assignment that involves implementing a set of geometric shapes, a shape container, a basic graphical user interface (GUI), and basic save/load capabilities. Additionally, it includes the implementation of JUnit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and methods, excluding the GUI classes.

## Features

- **Geometric Shapes**: Implementation of various geometric shapes including Point2D, Circle2D, Rect2D, Segment2D, Triangle2D, and Polygon2D.
- **Shape Container**: A collection to manage and manipulate the geometric shapes.
- **GUI**: A basic interface to allow users to draw shapes, select shapes, and choose colors.
- **Save/Load Capabilities**: Functions to save and load shape configurations.
- **JUnit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all geometric and collection classes to ensure correctness.

## Project Structure

- `Point2D`: Represents a point in a 2D space.
- `Circle2D`: Represents a circle defined by a center point and radius.
- `Rect2D`: Represents a rectangle.
- `Segment2D`: Represents a line segment between two points.
- `Triangle2D`: Represents a triangle.
- `Polygon2D`: Represents a polygon with multiple vertices.
- `ShapeCollection`: Manages a collection of geometric shapes.
- `GUIShape`: Represents a shape with graphical attributes.
- `Ex4`: Main class to run the application.
